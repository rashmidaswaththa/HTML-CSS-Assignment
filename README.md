# Instructions
The index.html file can be clicked to open the implemented application.

# Features
Rather than generating an image with text, I have utilized the overlay capability to provide color to the pictures in the Product and Solution sections.
Additionally, I added a slider to the right side of the Hero section. I made a separate slider for each slide in the time allowed. However, one slider can be used as a proposal to make it.
Additionally, since this is a one-page application, I didn't use component-based design in the present situation. We can use component-based architecture if there are more pages since they are easier to maintain and read the code for.
Additionally, I use the scrollspy feature to go from the navbar to the appropriate area in the Home page.
